#Refactoring a VBA_challenge file.

**Results:** With the Module 2 VBA_Challenge by refactoring the original VBA script I was able to shorten the the script in a 
                which in turn ran faster and took less memory from the CPU to process. The advantages of refactoring VBA code keeps it 
                dynamic and open to changes in the future. The disadvantages of not refactoring can cause huge data sets to take a long 
                time to process when running a macro. This module was very challenging.
