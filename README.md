#Refactoring a VBA_challenge file.

**Results:** With the Module 2 VBA_Challenge by refactoring the original VBA script I was able to shorten the the script by allowing the macro to run
              with less loops that only ran one time through the data set rather than multiple times. In turn the new refactored macro was able to 
              process faster than before and also faster by more than half a second. It also turn took less memory from the CPU to process. The advantages of refactoring VBA code               keeps it dynamic and open to changes in the future at a faster processing speed. The disadvantages of not refactoring can cause huge data sets to take a long 
              time to process when running a macro. Below are the final times and results of the database after refactoring.
