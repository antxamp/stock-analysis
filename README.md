### Overview: 
In this challenge, you’ll edit, or refactor, the Module 2 solution code to loop through all the data one time in order to collect the same information that you did in this module. Then, you’ll determine whether refactoring your code successfully made the VBA script run faster. Finally, you’ll present a written analysis that explains your findings.

### Resources: 
  - Microsoft Excel, VBScript
  - .xlsm files and .vbs starter code for challenge provided

### Objective:
#### Deliverable 1: Refactor VBA code and measure performance

#### Deliverable 2: A written analysis of your results (README.md)

### Results from Deliverable 1:
#### Steps taken to refactor the VBA include:

  - Combining sub statements into one script
  - Utilizing additional arrays to store values to decrease the amount of declared variables initializing
  - Restructuring for loops iterate through loops and output data
  - Refactoring lead to cleaner and more organized code as well as improved performance when running. Due to increased performance the VBA script runs noticeably faster than before refactoring:

### Summary: 
While refactoring code to increase functionality is always a great idea, its important to make note of the pros and cons.
For example, the clear pros of refactoring would be:

  - More organized code
  - Code better suits the task at hand
  - Code is optimized and runs faster

However, refactoring also entails these cons: -cons

  - The time it takes to refactor the code may not yield significant enough results
  - Can introduce errors to code in the process to something that already works
  
When considering refactoring code, which at its root is simply making the code more efficient without adding new functionality. It is important to consider if it is the right choice for you.
